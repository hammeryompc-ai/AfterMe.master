\# CONTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT



Any person contributing code, ideas, or assets to the Afterme Platform agrees that all contributions become the property of the project Owner, Tyler Hammond.



Contributors:

\- Retain ownership over their personal work outside this repo  

\- Transfer ownership of contributed work to Afterme  

\- Grant the Owner full rights to modify, use, and distribute contributed work  



This prevents disputes and protects the platform from ownership challenges.
